## Photo Gallery
A simple all-in-one php photo gallery script intended to be simply dropped into a directory of photos. It displays a list of the files in the directory, and when clicked, opens them in a lightbox with slideshow functionality (users can use the arrow keys or icons to switch between images in the folder). Designed to be a replacement for my photo gallery script for when the number of files is large enough that showing previews of each file onload is too cumbersome or resource-intensive.

150 lines of clean, well-commented php/html/css/js. Enjoy!
